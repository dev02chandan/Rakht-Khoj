# Blood Bank Website

## Project Description
The Blood Bank Website aims to create a platform that facilitates easy connections between blood donors and recipients. The website provides a user-friendly interface for individuals to register as both blood donors and recipients. Donors can offer their blood donations, while recipients can find and request blood donations when needed. The primary goal of the project is to bridge the gap between blood donors and those in urgent need of blood, thus contributing to saving lives.
